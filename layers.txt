N-layers

database
  - a file which store all application data.

src: all source code
  - entities: object mappings;
  - factories: instance generator;
  - repositories: data access;
  - routes: endpoints mappings;
  - services: communication between the routes and repositories layer (business logic);
  - util: shared code;
  - handler: communication between routes and server;
  - index.ts: server instance.

tests: all automated test suites
  - integration tests: testing on the user point of view. It's also an E2E test because there's no app consuming it;
  - unit tests: all tests that must run without any external connections such as database, external API and on our case, the fileSystem.
